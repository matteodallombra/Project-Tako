Home Assistant whole house remote

My custom remote controller to achieve whole house control.

Main goals:

- As close as possible to full home control, including TV control (I may pick the most used devices to start)
- Battery powered with USB-C recharge
- Fully enclosed in a decently compact and nice looking 3D printed case
- Custom buttons covers for easy to understand navigation
- Could the result score high wife approval? This may be a stretch goal, but letâ€™s try!

This repository is built to more easily host the full ESPHome code that runs on the ESP32 Board
